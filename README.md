# Fast Track to Rust

This Rustle GitHub repository contains the source code for the Rustle program,
developed over the course of the [Fast Track to Rust] book.

The [`mpsc`] branch holds the completed solution for the asynchronous
multithreaded exercise.

## Why the Name Rustle?

It's a play on the word "rust" and the sound of leaves rustling, suggesting the
program's ability to search through data efficiently.
