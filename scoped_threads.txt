When we work with scoped threads, the compiler can clearly see,
if the variables we want to use will be avilable to me.
Because of this visiblity, I'm runtime error free!
And issues in my code will be exposed by rustc.,
If this sort of safety is provided at native speeds,
there's simply no compelling case to stick with cpp!
